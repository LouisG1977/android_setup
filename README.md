# Android Setup Script
A script for setting up your Linux environment for Android development. This script will clone the [akhilnarang/scripts](https://github.com/akhilnarang/scripts) repository and run the necessary setup script based on your Linux distribution.

# Usage
Make the script executable with ```chmod +x android_setup.sh```

Run the script with ```./android_setup.sh```

The script will clone the akhilnarang/scripts repository and run the appropriate setup script for your Linux distribution.

# Support
This script supports the following Linux distributions:

- Ubuntu/Debian
- Manjaro/Arch/cachyos
- Solus
- Fedora

If your distribution is not supported, the script will exit with a message saying "Distribution Not Supported". But you can free to open a pull request or an issue and i will see if i can implement.

# Acknowledgments
Thank you to [akhilnarang](https://github.com/akhilnarang) for creating the scripts used in this project.
